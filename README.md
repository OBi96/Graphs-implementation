# Graphs-implementation
Author: Omar Ben Ismail

Description: This is a D3 implementation of a graphs. This project's code is based on the opendatastructes.org algorithms and Ross Kirsling's Directed Graph Editor implementation.

Instructions: 
The insert vertex button adds a new vertex to the graph (vertices can also be dragged using the mouse).
The insert edge option lets you select a source vertex to connect to a target vertex.
After selecting a starting vertex you can choose how you would like to traverse graph either "BFS' or "DFS".
Selecting the "none" option when for traversing clears the paths.
